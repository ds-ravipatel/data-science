Machine Learning Algorithms -
Two Types 
A) Supervised Learning Alorithms
   -- Works on Labeled Data
   -- Two Types of Supervised Learning
      i) Classification - process of predicting discrete class labels or categories
     ii) Regression - Process of predicting continuos values

B) Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
   -- Works on Unlabeled Data
   -- Model works on its own to discover information from data
   -- Unsupervised Techniques
      i) Clustering
     ii) Dimension Reduction
    iii) Density Estimation
     iv) Market Basket Analysis
